# cppCudaPhysicsSimulator


Welcome to `cppCudaPhysicsSimulator` - a project dedicated to showcasing skills 
in C++ and physics simulations. While CUDA is a part of the codebase, it is not 
actively tested in the CI/CD process (due to NVIDIA device restrictions with Github
Actions). The primary focus of this project is on nuclear reactors.


## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:
```
/cudaPhysicsSim
|-- /src
|   |-- /core
|   |-- /models
|   |-- /utils
|-- /tests
|   |-- CMakeLists.txt
|   |-- test_main.cpp
|-- /docs
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
|-- CMakeLists.txt
```

- **src**: Contains my source code.
  - **core**: Houses core functionalities and algorithms.
  - **models**: Various physics models, particularly nuclear reactors.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and classes.
- **tests**: Contains my test cases and related code.
- **docs**: Documentation generated by Doxygen or any related content.
- **CMakeLists.txt**: For build automation.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

I've chosen GitHub Actions for CI/CD as it's integrated directly with GitHub.

- The CI process is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
- This process handles building the project, running tests, and other necessary steps.
- The current implementation will:
1. Activate on every push or pull request to the main branch.
2. Set up the environment on an ubuntu-latest virtual machine.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: C++ tools and Google Test.
4. Build the project.
5. Run the tests.


## Testing

For testing, I am using the Google Test framework. Embracing TDD, 
tests are written before implementing functionalities. 
Each model or core functionality has corresponding test cases in the `tests` directory.

## Documentation

- I will utilize **Doxygen** for auto-generating code documentation.
- This `README.md` is kept updated with project details, build/run instructions, 
and other essential information.

## Simulations

I will start with basic physics simulations to establish the core framework and 
will gradually move towards more complex nuclear reactor simulations. 
The goal for each simulation is to:
- Highlight how CUDA's parallel processing improves performance.
- Demonstrate applied optimization techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Build the project using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.
4. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly.
5. Dive into the `src` directory and explore the simulations!
